# Plague Doctors

A JS script that puts an adorable scamp on your page.

### Next ideas:

1. Once the doctor arrives at an element it can do a number of things to it:

- What are some others?

2. User interactions

- If the user clicks on the image but is near the outside, the plague doctor freaks out and runs for cover
- Create controls where:
  - Have a button where they run around and clean up (after a few minutes or whatever)
  - You can spawn more doctors

3. Other things

- Maybe they fall asleep
- They change the magic lantern color
