# Plague Doctors

A JS script that puts an adorable scamp on your page.

### Next ideas:

1. Once the doctor arrives at an element it can do a number of things to it:

- Use its magic lantern to change the color of the background, border, and/or text of that element

2. User interactions

- If the user clicks on the image but is near the outside, the plague doctor freaks out and runs for cover
